# Flattening in Kotlin
Flattening refers to the process of converting a nested collection (a collection of collections) into a single flat collection by collapsing multiple levels of nesting.

This operation results in a one-dimensional collection containing all the elements from the nested collections.

### Flattening Collections using flatMap:

The `flatMap` function in Kotlin can be used to flatten collections by applying a transformation function to each element and then combining the results into a single list.

#### Example:

```kotlin
val nestedList = listOf(listOf(1, 2), listOf(3, 4, 5), listOf(6, 7))

val flattenedList: List<Int> = nestedList.flatMap { it }
// Result: flattenedList contains [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
```

In this example, `nestedList` is a list of lists. The `flatMap` function is used with a lambda that returns each inner list (`it`). This collapses the nested structure into a single list containing all the elements from the nested lists.

### Flattening Nested Collections of Different Types:

When dealing with nested collections of different types (e.g., lists of sets or lists of arrays), `flatMap` can still be used to flatten the structure by providing a transformation to convert each element into a common type.

#### Example:

```kotlin
val nestedListWithSets = listOf(setOf(1, 2), setOf(3, 4, 5), setOf(6, 7))

val flattenedListWithSets: List<Int> = nestedListWithSets.flatMap { it.toList() }
// Result: flattenedListWithSets contains [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
```

Here, `nestedListWithSets` is a list of sets. The `flatMap` function is applied, and each set is converted to a list using `it.toList()`. This flattens the structure into a single list containing all the elements from the nested sets.

Flattening collections is useful when you need to simplify nested structures or when you want to work with a single-level collection instead of dealing with nested elements, especially when applying operations or transformations on the elements.
