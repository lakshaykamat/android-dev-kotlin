# Android components

### 1. Activities:
- **Basic Unit:** An activity represents a single screen with a user interface.
- **Lifecycle:** Activities have a lifecycle consisting of methods like `onCreate()`, `onStart()`, `onResume()`, `onPause()`, `onStop()`, `onDestroy()`, etc.
- **User Interaction:** Handles user interactions, UI components, and responds to system-initiated actions.

### 2. Fragments:
- **Modular UI:** Fragments are reusable UI components within an activity that can contain their own layout and behavior.
- **Lifecycle:** Fragments have their lifecycle methods similar to activities.
- **UI Composition:** Multiple fragments can be combined within a single activity to build a multi-pane UI for tablets or responsive UIs.

### 3. Services:
- **Background Processing:** Services allow execution of long-running operations in the background without a UI.
- **Types of Services:** 
  - **Foreground Services:** Performs operations visible to the user, such as music playback.
  - **Background Services:** Performs operations in the background without direct user interaction.

### 4. Broadcast Receivers:
- **Event Handling:** Listens for system-wide broadcast announcements or custom events.
- **Registration:** Registered either in the manifest or dynamically at runtime.
- **Intents:** Responds to specific intents being broadcast by the system or other apps.

### 5. Content Providers:
- **Data Sharing:** Manages access to a shared set of app data or structured data stored in databases.
- **Encapsulation:** Provides a standardized interface to interact with the data regardless of its storage mechanism.
- **Content URIs:** Uses content URIs to access data within the content provider.

### Important Points:
- **Inter-Component Communication:** Components often interact with each other using intents, enabling different parts of the app to work together.
- **Lifecycle Management:** Understanding the lifecycle of each component is crucial for proper resource management and ensuring a smooth user experience.
- **AndroidManifest.xml:** Components are declared and configured in the manifest file to specify their behavior and relationships.

Mastering these fundamental Android components is essential for building robust and well-structured Android applications, as they form the core architecture of an Android app and facilitate its functionality.
