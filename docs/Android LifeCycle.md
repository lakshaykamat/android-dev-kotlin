# Android Lifecyle
In Android, the Activity Lifecycle describes the different states that an activity goes through from its creation to its destruction. Understanding the activity lifecycle is crucial for managing the behavior and state of your Android application.

Here are the key states and methods in the activity lifecycle:

1. **Created (`onCreate()`):** The activity is created. This is where initialization should take place, such as UI setup and resource allocation.

2. **Started (`onStart()`):** The activity becomes visible to the user. This is a good place to start animations or other visual effects.

3. **Resumed (`onResume()`):** The activity is in the foreground and interacting with the user. This is the ideal state for performing tasks that need the user's attention.

4. **Paused (`onPause()`):** The activity loses focus but is still visible. This is a good place to save data that should persist even if the user navigates away.

5. **Stopped (`onStop()`):** The activity is no longer visible to the user. Resources can be released or operations paused in this state.

6. **Destroyed (`onDestroy()`):** The activity is being destroyed, either because the user has explicitly finished it or the system is freeing up resources.

Here's a brief explanation of the transitions:

- **Create → Start → Resume:** This is the normal flow when the activity becomes visible to the user.

- **Resume → Pause:** When another activity comes to the foreground, the current activity is paused.

- **Pause → Stop:** When the activity is no longer visible, it moves to the stopped state.

- **Stop → Restart → Start → Resume:** When the user navigates back to the activity, it goes through the restart process.

- **Resume → Destroy:** If the user explicitly finishes the activity or the system needs to free up resources, the activity is destroyed.

To handle these states, you can override the corresponding lifecycle methods in your `Activity` class. For example:

```kotlin
class MyActivity : AppCompatActivity() {

    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        // Initialization code
    }

    override fun onStart() {
        super.onStart()
        // Start animations or other visual effects
    }

    override fun onResume() {
        super.onResume()
        // Perform tasks that need the user's attention
    }

    override fun onPause() {
        super.onPause()
        // Save data or pause operations
    }

    override fun onStop() {
        super.onStop()
        // Release resources or pause operations
    }

    override fun onDestroy() {
        super.onDestroy()
        // Clean up resources
    }
}
```

Understanding and managing the activity lifecycle is essential for creating responsive and robust Android applications.
